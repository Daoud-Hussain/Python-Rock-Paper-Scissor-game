It was my first ever game in Python. It encouraged me to learn more about progamming. It increased my interest in programming when it ran successfully without any bug. 
Rules:
The familiar game of Rock, Paper, Scissors is played like this: at the same time, two players display one of three symbols: a rock, paper, or scissors. A rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper by cutting it, and paper beats rock by covering it. ... Whenever one player wins, the other loses.
